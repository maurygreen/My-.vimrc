# **My-config**
My .vimrc and my .Xmodmap. Here just for not loosing them. Keep in mind that I use dvorak-intl keyboard layout.


### .vimrc
Some settings for my vim. Tabs, indent and some mappings. Very basic rigth now.

The colorscheme used is [here](https://github.com/encody/vim-colors) (hope it remains there).

### .Xmodmap
Currently, this swaps the left ctrl key and the caps lock key.


>##### _Dear me of the future:_
>Remember to update this repo every time you update your .vimrc. You are going to thank me in your future.

>Love, you.
