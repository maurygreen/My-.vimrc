# **My-config**
My .vimrc and my .Xmodmap. Here just for not loosing them. Keep in mind that I use dvorak-intl keyboard layout.


### .vimrc
Some settings for my vim. Tabs, indent and some mappings. Very basic right now.

###### Requisites
+ [apt-vim](https://github.com/egalpin/apt-vim) (for installing plugins)
+ [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
+ [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)
+ [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive.git)
+ The colorscheme used is [here](https://github.com/encody/vim-colors) (optional).

### .Xmodmap
Currently, this swaps the left ctrl key and the caps lock key.


>##### _Dear me of the future:_
>Remember to update this repo every time you update your .vimrc. You are going to thank me in your future.
