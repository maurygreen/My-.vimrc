# My-.vimrc
My .vimrc. Here just for not loosing it. Keep in mind that I use dvorak-intl keyboard layout.


The colorscheme used is [here](https://github.com/encody/vim-colors) (hope it remains there).


>##### _Dear me of the future:_
>Remember to update this repo every time you update your .vimrc. You are going to thank me in your future.
